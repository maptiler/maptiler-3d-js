### 3.0.0

## ✨ New Features
- GLTF Models are now animateable 🎬 🚀
- New `Item3D` class allows for UI events on individual meshes, click, dblclick, mouseenter and mouseleave
- `Item3D` class instances can also have "states" similar to pseudo classes in DOM elements.
- Rather than each Layer3D having their own renderer instance, rendering is now batched and rendered by a single render manager instance making it more efficient and more performant.
- Meshes can now have one-off user-defined transforms applied when they are added to the scene. This can be useful for ensuring all meshes have the same rotation / face the same way, or if they need their world position tweaked without tweaking their LngLat.
